# YouTube Skipper

Automatically skip all video ads on YouTube.

With this script installed, you will never have to worry about clicking the Skip Ad butten again. This is not an AdBlocker, meaning you're still supporting your favourite creators with Ad monetization. Be aware that those ads that are shown for at least 5 seconds before allowing you to skip them, will only be skipped once the countdown ends. If you whant to skip them directly you'll need and AdBlocker such as 1Blocker or AdGuard.

The standalone browser extension will be availble soon.
You can also install this script through [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/423725).
